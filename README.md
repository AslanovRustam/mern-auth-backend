# Server

The backend is built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) and [Resend](https://resend.com) (for sending emails). There is also a Postman collection for testing the API. JWTs are stored in secure, HTTP-only cookies.
Includes:

- register, login, logout, profile, account verification, password reset
- send emails for account verification and password reset
- get and remove sessions

## API Architecture

The API is built using different layers: routes, controllers, services and models.

- Routes are responsible for handling the incoming requests and forwarding them to the appropriate controller.
- Controllers are responsible for validating the request, calling the appropriate service, and sending back the response.
- Services are responsible for handling the business logic. They interact with the database and any external services. Services may also call other services.
- Models are responsible for interacting with the database. They contain the schema and any model utility methods.

\*\*\* For simple GET or DELETE requests that don't require any business logic, the controller may directly interact with the model.

#### Error Handling

Errors are handled using a custom error handler middleware. The error handler middleware catches all errors that occur in the application and processes them accordingly. Each controller needs to be wrapped with the `errorCatch()` utility function to ensure that any errors that are thrown within the controller are caught and passed on to the error handler middleware.

## Run Locally

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Before running the server, you need to add your ENV variables. Create a `.env` file and use the `sample.env` file as a reference.
For development, you can set the `EMAIL_SENDER` to a random string, since the emails are sent with a resend sandbox account (when running locally).

```bash
cp sample.env .env
# open .env and add your variables
```

Start the MongoDB server (if running locally)

```bash
# using homebrew
brew services start mongodb-community@7.0
```

Start the API server

```bash
# runs on http://localhost:4004 (default)
npm run dev
```

### Postman Collection

There is a Postman collection in the `backend` directory that you can use to test the API. The `postman.json` contains requests for all the routes in the API. You can [import the JSON directly](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-data/#import-postman-data) into Postman.
